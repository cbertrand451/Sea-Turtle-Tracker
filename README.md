# Sea Turtle GPS Tracking Dashboard

This Streamlit web app visualizes the real-world movement of juvenile loggerhead sea turtles using satellite-based GPS tracking data from 2002-2005. This project uses data from OBIS-SEAMAP. Each turtle's path is drawn on an interactive map, along with rich summary statistics including distance traveled, speed, and location metrics.

## Features
Interactive Map — View each turtle's GPS path across the ocean using pydeck.

Turtle Selection — Choose individual turtles to explore their movement patterns.

Turtle Metrics Sidebar — See segment count, total distance, average speed, and start/end dates.

Visual Cues — Green and red markers highlight starting and ending locations.

Responsive Layout — Built with Streamlit's column layout for a dashboard-like experience.
